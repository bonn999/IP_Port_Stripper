# IP_Port_Stripper
This is a :PORT stripper that I have made in C++ for the fact you cant really get stripped ips online.

I made this port stripper because of my View Bot needing to use Raw ips without the ports and I download my ips from proxy-list.download, they come with the ports attached so you can connect to a server using the ip and port to stay 'anonymous'. With the solution I have we will under go the middle man and use our own ips with a 100% up rate and close to an infinite amount of ips.

  *How do you use this?
    When you launch the program it will ask you for the .txt file to Read from. This file should contain the proxies '111.11.111.1:PORT', and it will need the new .txt file it will be writing to. The disired input should look like this C:\ipDir\input.txt and for the output C:\ipDir\output.txt NOTE you will have to set up two seperate file such as a file to read from and a second file to write to. The output file should look like this when the process is finished.

  *Why, Just Y?
    Well because, Too much work to link my view bot to a gui and use chromium and use actual proxies rn. Soo here is a solution for the confusion.
